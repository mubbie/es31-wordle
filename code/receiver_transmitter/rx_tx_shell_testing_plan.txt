## TEST BENCH TESTING PLAN 
## FOR SCI_RX_TX COMBO COMPONENT 

port map (
        clk_ext_port => clk_ext_signal,
        RsTx_ext_port => RsTx_ext_signal,
        RsRx_ext_port => RsRx_ext_signal,
        Rx_data_port => Rx_data_ext_signal
    );

-- INITIALLY 
    -- Expect: 
        -- clk_ext_signal = 0
        -- RsTx_ext_signal = 1 i.e. nothing is transmitting out of the component 
        -- RsRx_ext_signal = 1 i.e. nothing is receiving into the component
        -- Rx_data_ext_signal = "11111111" i.e. nothing sensible has been receiving

-- TESTING 
    -- Send some valid characters to the Receiver (via RsRx_ext_port): 
        -- 'A' i.e. 0x41, "01000001", Rx would go "0100000101" 

    -- Expect:
    -- After the data has been loaded into the receiver, send it into the parallel in for the transmitter: 
        -- Parallel in to the transmitter should be: 
            -- "01000001"
    
    -- Finally: 
        -- the transmitter should move out: 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1
        -- via the RsTx_ext_port 

-- VALIDATION  
    -- Rx_data_port should be "01000001"
        -- after the data has been loaded into the receiver
    -- Watch the RsTx_ext_port to see if the data is being transmitted out correctly
