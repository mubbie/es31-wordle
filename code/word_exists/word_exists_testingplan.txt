## TEST BENCH TESTING PLAN 
## FOR WORD_EXISTS COMPONENT

PORT MAP (
        -- inputs 
        clk_in			=> clk_signal,
        guess      	    => guess_signal,
        word_ready	    => word_ready_signal,

        -- outputs 
        is_dict_word    => is_dict_word_signal,
        not_in_dict     => not_in_dict_signal
    )

-- INITIALLY 
    -- the output should be all zeros 

-- TESTING 
    -- Try to check for a word that exists in the dictionary, and one that does not 
    -- guess is "model" 
        -- that is "0110110101101111011001000110010101101100"
        -- set word ready high 
        -- is dict word should go high 
        -- not in dict should stay low 
    -- guess is "abcde"
        -- that is "0110000101100010011000110110010001100101"
        -- set word ready high
        -- is dict word should stay low
        -- not in dict should go high

-- IMPLEMENTATION 
    -- store the guesses in a register file 
        -- the array should be of size 2 
        -- each element in the array should be 40 bits 
    -- iterate over the elements in the array and use them to test 

-- VALIDATION
    -- everything works, if the output matches the specification above, under "TESTING"
