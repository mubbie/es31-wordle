## RESOURCES

- **Logisim**: https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution
  - Notes: 
    - Logisim requires a Java runtime
- **draw.io**: https://app.diagrams.net/
  - Update: We could also save draw.io files in other format so that we can easily view them on github, e.g. as an editable vector i.e. SVG
  - Usage (Create New Drawing):
    - If necessary, create a branch and/or directory on the github repo for the new diagram
    - Go to the site for draw.io
    - Start with an "Untitled Diagram"
    - Go to "File" and select "Save as..." or type Ctrl+Shift+S (PC)/Cmd+Shift+S (Mac) to access "Save as..." quickly
    - Give the drawing a filename
    - Select Github
      - If you have never authorized draw.io to use Github you will have to go through the steps to do so
      - Otherwise, you can continue
    - Select the repo where you will want to save the drawing, in this case `es31-wordle`
    - Select the branch where you want to save
    - Select the directory where you want to save
    - Select "OK" and you are good to go
    - draw.io will ask you to type a small commit message and your work will go directly to Github
  - Usage (Open Drawing from Repo):
    - Go to the site for draw.io
    - Go to "File"
    - Select "Open from" (Subsequently, you can just use "Open Recent >")
    - Select "Github..."
    - Select the repo, in this case `es31-wordle`
    - Select the branch
    - Select the directory
    - Select the file
    - You have the option to open in the current window or in a new window
  - Usage (Saving your work):
    - As you work draw.io will let you know that you have unsaved changes
    - Select the option above that asks you to save
    - You will get a prompt to type a commit message
    - Type and save and you are good to go
  - Notes:
    - The draw.io file saved on Github is in raw `XML` format, so you cannot open it directly from Github, thus you need to open the file from draw.io itself
